            <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>

            <div>

                <p>The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,” said Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”</p>

                <p>“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.</p>

                <p>“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to ask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”</p>

                <p>“Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a man of the name of Hyde.”</p>

                <p>“Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?”</p>

                <p>“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment.”</p>

                <p>Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at last.</p>

                <p>“My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself.</p>
