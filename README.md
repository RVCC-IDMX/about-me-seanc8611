My name is Sean Clarke and my Netlify status badge is [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2aec128d-3ebe-4c65-bb27-827a911a263e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-seanc8611/deploys). The purpose of this project is to create an About Me website to help me understand HTML to create web pages, format pages with CSS, learn to verify/debug code, be sensitive to accessibility issues, and to understand good design principles. Some skills I learned were adding HTML, adding images/links, adding style with CSS, creating a NAV bar, and more. I used the blue and orange color scheme.
